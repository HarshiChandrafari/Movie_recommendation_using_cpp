Here's an example of how you can structure your README file to explain the project in detail, including how you predict the top 5 movies and how you get a rating for a particular movie.

# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project implements a **Movie Recommendation System** that predicts top movies for a user and provides a predicted rating for a movie the user has not rated yet, based on similarities with other users. The system uses a **cosine similarity** method to calculate user similarity and a **weighted average** technique to predict ratings.

### Key Features
- **Top 5 Movie Prediction**: Recommend the top 5 movies to a user based on their similarity to other users.
- **Rating Prediction**: Predict the rating a user would give to a movie that they have not yet rated, based on ratings from similar users.

## How the System Works

### 1. **Predicting Top 5 Movies for a User**

The top 5 movies for a user are predicted based on their **similarity** with other users. Here is how it works:

- **Step 1: User-User Similarity Calculation**
  We compute the similarity between the target user and all other users using the **cosine similarity** measure, which is based on the ratings given by users to the movies. The cosine similarity between two users' rating vectors is calculated as:
  
  \[
  \text{Cosine Similarity} = \frac{\sum{(a_i \cdot b_i)}}{\sqrt{\sum{a_i^2}} \cdot \sqrt{\sum{b_i^2}}}
  \]
  where \( a_i \) and \( b_i \) are the ratings of the two users for movie \(i\).

- **Step 2: Weighting Similarity**
  Once we have the similarity values between the target user and other users, we use the similarity score as a weight to predict ratings for movies that the target user hasn't rated yet.

- **Step 3: Predicting Movie Ratings**
  For each movie that the target user hasn't rated, we compute a **weighted average rating** from the other users. This weighted average is calculated using the ratings from similar users, with higher weights given to more similar users.

- **Step 4: Sorting and Selecting Top 5 Movies**
  After calculating the predicted ratings for all unrated movies, the system sorts them by predicted rating in descending order and selects the top 5 movies to recommend to the user.

### 2. **Predicting the Rating for a Particular Movie**

For a particular movie that a user has not rated yet, the system predicts the rating using the **weighted average method**. Here's how it works:

- **Step 1: Compute Similarities**
  The system computes the cosine similarity between the target user and all other users based on their movie ratings.

- **Step 2: Weighted Rating Calculation**
  The predicted rating for the movie is calculated as the **weighted average** of the ratings from similar users. The weight is the similarity between the target user and each other user. Only users who have rated the movie are considered in the calculation.

- **Step 3: Handle Missing Similarities**
  If there are no similar users (i.e., the similarity sum is zero), the system returns a default rating (in this case, `0.0`).

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites
- C++ Compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- C++11 or later support

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommendation-system.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd movie-recommendation-system
   ```

3. Compile the C++ code:
   ```bash
   g++ -o recommendation_system main.cpp
   ```

4. Run the system:
   ```bash
   ./recommendation_system
   ```

### Data Format

1. **Movies Data**: The movie dataset contains movie IDs, titles, and tags (optional). Each movie is represented as:
   ```csv
   movie_id, movie_title, movie_tags
   ```

2. **Ratings Data**: The ratings dataset contains user ratings for movies. Each entry represents a rating by a user for a specific movie:
   ```csv
   user_id, movie_id, rating, timestamp
   ```

### Example Data
- Movies:
  ```
  1374, "Movie A", "Action, Comedy"
  2492, "Movie B", "Drama, Romance"
  5678, "Movie C", "Horror, Thriller"
  ```

- Ratings:
  ```
  0, 1374, 4.5, 1234567890
  0, 2492, 3.0, 1234567890
  1, 1374, 5.0, 1234567890
  1, 2492, 2.5, 1234567890
  ```

## Code Explanation

### 1. **Cosine Similarity Function**

The **cosine similarity** function computes the similarity between two vectors of ratings for users. If either user has a `NaN` value in their ratings, those entries are skipped during the similarity calculation.

### 2. **Prediction Function**

The `predict_rating` function calculates the predicted rating for a particular movie for the target user. It uses the **weighted average** of ratings from other users who are similar to the target user, with the similarity score acting as a weight.

### 3. **Recommendation Function**

The `recommend_movies` function uses the `predict_rating` function to predict the ratings for all movies that the target user hasn't rated yet. It then sorts the movies by predicted rating and returns the top 5 movies.

## Example Usage

1. **Predict Top 5 Movies for User 1**:
   - The system calculates the similarity between User 1 and all other users.
   - It predicts ratings for all unrated movies based on the ratings from similar users.
   - The top 5 movies are then selected and recommended to User 1.

2. **Predict Rating for a Movie (e.g., Movie 2492) for User 0**:
   - The system calculates the similarity between User 0 and all other users.
   - It predicts the rating User 0 would give to Movie 2492 based on ratings from similar users.

---

## Example Output

```
Top 5 Recommendations for User 1:
1. Movie A - Predicted Rating: 4.2
2. Movie C - Predicted Rating: 3.8
3. Movie D - Predicted Rating: 3.5
4. Movie B - Predicted Rating: 3.3
5. Movie E - Predicted Rating: 3.0

Predicted Rating for User 0 on Movie ID 2492: 3.7
```
